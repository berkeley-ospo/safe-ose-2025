# safe-ose-2025

Stefan and Jarrod are submitting a preliminary proposals to the Safe-OSE solicitation:
https://new.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/safe-ose-safety-security-privacy-open-source-ecosystems/nsf24-608/solicitation

The proposal would cover 50% of Stefan and 50% of Jarrod for the first year and 100% of Stefan and 100% of Jarrod for the second year.
It would also fund two smallish developer (security) summits the first year and three the second year.

We would like feedback and ideas for the following three items:

3. Articulate the targeted classes of safety, security, and/or privacy vulnerabilities to be addressed and the broader impacts of addressing them. Discuss, as appropriate, the potential attacks that could take advantage of these vulnerabilities.
4. Briefly describe a development plan to address these vulnerabilities.
5. Briefly describe an evaluation plan to assess the efficacy of the work.
