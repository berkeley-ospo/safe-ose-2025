-->

The $\spose$ is a mature, vibrant open-source ecosystem of independent, interconnected projects used by researchers across diverse scientific disciplines to perform complex analyses, simulations, and visualizations.
At its core are libraries widely used in computational science, such as NumPy (numerical computing) \citep{vanderwalt2011numpy, harris2020array} and SciPy (scientific algorithms) \citep{virtanen2020scipy}.
Domain-specific projects, such as Astropy (astronomy), Scikit-HEP (particle physics), and Pangeo (geoscience), build upon these core libraries to provide specialized tools for various fields.

The $\spose$ supports global communities of practice that collaboratively work to address emerging scientific needs.
It employs a decentralized governance structure, with individual projects retaining autonomy over their leadership, decision-making, and development processes.
This community-driven approach allows for rapid innovation while seeking community consensus around ecosystem-wide decisions and standards.

In 2020, the PIs founded the **Scientific Python Project ($\spp$)** \citep{spp} to sustain the $\spose$ and support its community of contributors and maintainers.
It has since grown rapidly, with 69 members in its GitHub organization and 446 members on its Discourse forum.
Through the $\spp$, the PIs recruited a governing team of community leaders and managers, established central community spaces, brought developers together for cross-project Developer Summits, updated and maintained classic community-owned learning resources, aggregated and disseminated best development practices, and built and supported common maintainer tooling.

We also created the **Scientific Python Ecosystem Coordination ($\spec$)** process \citep{specs} to help establish cross-project technical specifications, highlight shared resources, and document best practices.
We formed a **$\specsteering$** and engaged an initial set of 
**$\spcore$** (IPython \citep{perez2007ipython}, NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib \citep{hunter2007matplotlib}, Pandas \citep{mckinney-proc-scipy-2010}, NetworkX \citep{hagberg2008}, scikit-image \citep{vanderwalt2014scikit}, scikit-learn \citep{scikit-learn}, xarray \citep{hoyer2017xarray}, and zarr).
The **$\specsteering$**, comprising a diverse group of 17 volunteers from various projects in the ecosystem, oversees the $\spec$ process with input from the larger community and in consultation with the maintainers of the $\spcore$.
We also formed a **$\toolsteering$** to oversee the maintainence of a growing collection of tools that help projects across the ecosystem, including those supporting the $\spec$s.
Through these and other community initiatives, the $\spp$ fosters interoperability, reduces maintenance burden, and provides a more cohesive experience for users.

# Targeted Classes of Vulnerabilities and Broader Impacts

<!--
    3. Articulate the targeted classes of safety, security, and/or privacy vulnerabilities to be addressed and the broader impacts of addressing them. Discuss, as appropriate, the potential attacks that could take advantage of these vulnerabilities.
-->

Despite its crucial role, the $\spose$ faces several critical classes of vulnerabilities that, if exploited, could have profound consequences for scientific integrity, national security, and industry.
While we have identified these vulnerabilities separately for clarity, it is crucial to recognize that, in real-world attacks, these vulnerabilities are exploited in combination, creating complex and multifaceted threats.
This interconnected nature of security risks underscores the need for a holistic approach to safeguarding the $\spose$, one that addresses all vulnerabilities simultaneouslyâ€”a task that requires substantial work beyond what volunteer efforts alone can achieve.

## Supply Chain (Vulnerability) {-}

The $\spose$, as an extensive network of independent, interconnected libraries, is particularly susceptible to supply chain attacks.
An attacker could potentially compromise a widely-used dependency, inserting malicious code that would propagate throughout the ecosystem.
Many scientific Python projects currently lack robust cryptographic signing and verification processes for releases, leaving them vulnerable to tampering and unauthorized modifications.
The ecosystem also lacks a centralized system for reporting, tracking, and responding to vulnerabilities across projects.
These risks have been clearly illustrated by the recent Ultralytics supply-chain attack, which demonstrated the potential for widespread impact through compromised dependencies \citep{pypi2024ultralytics}.

## Access Controls (Vulnerability) {-}

Current contributor management systems within the $\spose$ often lack granular access controls, with access granting and revocation typically performed manually and in an ad-hoc manner.
This shortcoming potentially exposes projects to insider threats and unauthorized code changes.
A compromised account with broad access could be used to insert malicious code into core libraries, affecting countless downstream projects and users.
The absence of multi-factor authentication and automated access audits further exacerbates these risks.
Maintainers frequently retain access rights long after they have ceased active contribution, unnecessarily expanding the potential attack surface.
Recent attacks exploiting compromised maintainer credentials demonstrate the severe consequences of inadequate access controls \citep{checkmarx2024python}.

## Insider Attacks (Vulnerability) {-}

The ecosystem's inclusive approach, which encourages contributions from a global community of (mostly self-selecting) volunteers, expands the potential attack surface.
This risk is compounded by a maintainer onboarding model that often elevates privileges to active contributors without comprehensive vetting.
The reliance on an over-worked volunteer developer community can lead to reduced vigilance and oversight.
The complexity and breadth of some core libraries, and how they are used in combination, makes it challenging for any single individual to have a comprehensive understanding of risks, potentially allowing subtle malicious changes to go unnoticed.
These risks have been starkly highlighted by recent high-profile attacks, such as the XZ incident \citep{kaspersky2024xz, newman2024mystery}, a multi-year effort likely originating from a nation-state actor.


## Broader Impacts of Mitigation {-}

By addressing the above classes of vulnerabilities, we will not only secure the $\spose$, but will also set new standards for open-source security in scientific computing.
The broader impact of this work therefore extends beyond the immediate ecosystem, establishing best practices in open-source development, enhancing the reliability of scientific software worldwide, and ultimately contributing to more secure and trustworthy scientific advancements across all disciplines.

# Development Plan

<!--
    4. Briefly describe a development plan to address these vulnerabilities.
-->

Establishing comprehensive security measures requires substantial technical and socio-technical work beyond what volunteer efforts can achieve.
Yet, crucially, it must integrate community feedback.
To address critical vulnerabilities and significantly enhance the safety, security, and privacy of the $\spose$, we will leverage the $\spec$ process.
In collaboration with the $\spcommunity$, we will develop ecosystem-wide security standards and best practices, leveraging and improving existing efforts as appropriate.
As necessary, we will develop tools and services to help the community implement security $\spec$s effectively.

The SPEC process has already demonstrated its effectiveness in addressing ecosystem-wide security challenges through initiatives like SPEC 6 â€” Keys to the Castle \citep{spec6}, published in February 2024; and SPEC 8 â€” Securing the Release Process \citep{spec8}, developed during the May 2024 $\spp$ Developer Summit.

<!--
The SPEC process has already demonstrated its effectiveness in addressing ecosystem-wide security challenges through initiatives like SPEC 6 â€” Keys to the Castle \citep{spec6}, which tackles access control vulnerabilities, and SPEC 8 â€” Securing the Release Process \citep{spec8}, which addresses supply chain security.
While these early successes show community recognition of and engagement with cross-project security work, the scope and complexity of the identified vulnerabilities require sustained, dedicated effort beyond what volunteer contributions alone can achieve.
-->

<!--For each threat category listed below, we aim to have one or more $\spec$s endorsed by at least two $\spcore$ projects and adopted by three or more ecosystem projects in the first year.
By the second year, we plan to increase this to at least seven $\spcore$ endorsements and adoption by ten or more ecosystem projects.-->

To ensure the widespread adoption of security $\spec$s, we will organize a series of $\spp$ Developer Summits that include hands-on workshops to help projects adopt new security recommendations, processes, and tooling.
We will also publicize the security $\spec$s via our various communication and outreach channels as well as at annual conferences.

## Supply Chain (Remediation) {-}

We will work toward implementing a coordinated vulnerability disclosure, audit, and response process, including a centralized system for reporting and tracking vulnerabilities.
We will develop protocols for responsible disclosure and coordination of fixes across affected projects, and implement an automated notification system for affected downstream projects and users.
To improve cryptographic practices, we will work with the community to develop $\spec$s for cryptographically signing and verifying software dependencies.
This includes developing tools to simplify the signing process, and integrating verification checks into package managers and CI/CD pipelines.

## Access Control (Remediation) {-}

Together with the $\spcommunity$, we will design and implement $\spec$s around fine-grained permissions models for project repositories.
This model will be tailored to the unique needs of open-source scientific projects, balancing security with the collaborative nature of our community.
We will develop recommendations around passkeys and multi-factor authentication, and provide mechanisms to perform automated access audits and anomaly detection.
This will help maintainers monitor and manage access more effectively.

## Insider Attacks (Remediation) {-}

The ecosystem lacks a systematic way to evaluate the trustworthiness and reliability of contributors across projects.
We propose developing a web-of-trust and reputation system to help maintainers evaluate code submissions from new contributors.
Such a system would provide a more nuanced view of a contributor's history and reliability across the ecosystem, addressing some of the risks associated with an inclusive contribution model.
To address the challenge of overworked volunteer developers who fail to notice adverse behavior, and enhance their ability to focus on critical code review, we will collaborate on $\spec$s for (possibly AI-assisted) anomaly detection systems.
These systems will analyze contribution patterns and flag potential security issues in both existing code and new pull requests, helping to identify subtle malicious changes in complex codebases.
By automating initial screening processes, we aim to allow for more efficient allocation of human resources to areas requiring expert attention, addressing the issue of reduced vigilance due to volunteer overload.

# Evaluation Plan

<!--
    5. Briefly describe an evaluation plan to assess the efficacy of the work.
-->

To assess the efficacy of our work in enhancing the safety, security, and privacy of the $\spose$, we will implement a comprehensive evaluation strategy:

## $\spec$ Process {-}

The $\spec$ Process is designed to ensure community support for proposed security initiatives.
The $\specsteering$ ensures community ownership of decision-making on $\spec$s, fostering broad acceptance across the ecosystem.
Endorsement from $\spcore$ projects provides a clear indication of the acceptance and integration of our security initiatives within the core ecosystem.
Project adoption demonstrates the reach and impact of our security measures beyond the core projects.
The $\toolsteering$ ensures we are creating common resources that address needs according to community standards, procedures, and practices.
We aim to have each $\spec$'s security measures adopted by three within its first year, and seven by the end of its second.
Additionally, we aim to have each $\spec$ *endorsed* by two core projects within its first year, and five by the end of its second.
These metrics provide a clear indicator of the reach and impact our security measures have across the $\spose$.

## $\spsecurity$ Oversight {-}

We will establish a $\spsecurity$ by recruiting a diverse group of developers and maintainers from across the ecosystem to provide ongoing guidance and oversight of our security initiatives.
This group will hold monthly meetings to evaluate progress, discuss challenges, and suggest directions to explore, ensuring that our efforts remain aligned with community needs and best practices.
Based on what we learn in these meetings, we will develop sustainable strategies for the long-term implementation and maintenance of security measures beyond the grant period.

## External Advisory Board {-}

We will form an external advisory board with representatives from diverse $\spose$ end-user organizations.
This board will include members from domain-specific projects (e.g., IRIS-HEP and Vera Rubin Observatory), industry (e.g., Google and CZ BioHub), national computing facilities (e.g., San Diego Supercomputer Center and TrustedCI), <!-- and funding agencies () --> and open-source foundations (e.g., PSF and OpenSSF), providing an authoratitive perspective on the impact of our mitigations and activities, rooted in day-to-day experience.

We will conduct quarterly virtual meetings with this board to ensure that our work aligns with stakeholder needs and expectations, allowing for timely adjustments to our approach as necessary.
Through these interactions, we will collect and analyze feedback to measure the perceived value and real-world impact of our implemented security measures.
